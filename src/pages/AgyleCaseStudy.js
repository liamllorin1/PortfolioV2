When asked, he explained that there are many ways to reach that point, to land that first tryout. In most cases, a player has to rely on agent who will make that tryout happen. How could he hope to find said agent? Connections. "The soccer world is smaller than you think", he expressed.', 'Eli (pictured right) is currently making a huge transition from D1 ball to playing overseas. It all started with a chance introduction from a friend who was interning abroad: before Eli knew it, he had met an agent who was pulling strings and connecting him to teams in Germany. What struck me  was how Eli had made the most of his sparse connections in Europe.

The onboarding user flow breaks this down into bite-sized chunks, allowing the user to skip the onboarding\'s completion even though they will need to finish it before they take advantage of the app\'s functionality.', 'Linkedin allows for users to connect with eachother and recommends other professionals based on similar networks.
